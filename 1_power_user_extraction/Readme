Instructions for running codes:

Step 1: run python3 num_calls.py data_file
data_file is the file created from 0_data_gen. Currently, we are using file merge_11cols.csv
This will generate the cumulative distribution of users according to the number of calls they made. Select the desired cutoff
and set th1 in line 83 of thresh.py. Put a very large value for th2 (will be decided later).

Step 2: run python3 thresh.py data_file
data file is again merge_11cols.csv. Set values of th1 and th2 as described above. A new file thresh_th1_th2.csv will be generated
with those users who did not satisfy the threshold requirements removed.

Step 3: run python3 keys_pressed.py data_file
data file is again merge_11cols.csv. This will generate the cumulative distribution of users according to their keys pressed per second. 
Select the desired cutoff and set th2 in line 84 of thresh.py. (Note that as we have plotted the -log on the x axis, users having
rate below that value will be selected.)

Step 4: run python3 thresh.py data_file
data file is merge_11cols.csv. The values of th1 and th2 would have been set by now. A final file containing power users only,
thresh_th1_th2.csv will be created.
