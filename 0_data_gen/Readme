After obtaining the results of analyze_campaign.py.
We worked only on the following aspects of topics. Sir had removed many campaign-categories from consideration, where their meaning was ambiguous and the moderators may not have coded these items consistently. You can also remove from here some aspects with very few items, if needed.
This code merges the following types of aspects only for MDD(for other topics this was handled later in some other code) -
* In-depth knowledge on age-appropriate feeding - Diversity/Food groups 
* In-depth knowledge on age-appropriate feeding - Consistency of food
