## Description of files

# model.py
To run these models -
python model<number>.py r k T min_exp aspect_item_dict r_file

Input:
r : number of rank slots
k : number of intervals
T : total time duration
min_exp : min % exposure to give to each aspect
aspect_item_dict : pickled dictionary of aspects with items mapped to them which were positive
r_file : file containing number of users coming to rank i per minute
A time slot of time T is divided into k intervals. In each interval we rank r items

Output: aspect_exp_1.txt, res1.pickle, hhi1.pickle, item_exp_1.csv

# compare.py
To run this file -
python compare.py
Input: hhi<index>.pickle, res<index>.pickle
Output: rmse, hhi plots generated


# modulators model
STEP 1: <topic>_slots.py
To run this file - python <topic>_slots.py
Input: 
Change variable "path" to path of bmgf data
<topic>_items.pickle - same as in ../Data/<topic> (according which topic you are working on)
Output: <topic>_data_jj.csv file is generated

STEP 2: <topic>_list.py
To run this file - python <topic>_list.py
Input: 
<topic>_data_jj.csv file
item_asp_map.pickle - generated in 10_network_analysis/item_asp.py
<topic>_items.pickle - same as in ../Data/<topic> (according which topic you are working on)
R10.txt - no.of people reaching at any rank
Output: 
hhim_cf.pickle
aspect_exp_m_cf.txt
item_exp_m_cf.csv

--These file are used in compare.py
change model6 to these files accordingly
