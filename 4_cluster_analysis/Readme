For analysis of clustering done (comparing preference lists of clusters formed)
code: analysis.py
inputs:
1. file containing clusters (output of 2_kprototype.py in 2_power_user_extraction)
2. file containing preference vectors of unique users (output of 1_entropy_heard.py in 2_power_user_extraction)
code outputs a file with the name cluster_file_name + 'analysis.txt' containing ranked lists for each cluster from most to least
preferred (sourcextheme) pairs.


For comparing how similar 2 clusterings are:
code: compare_clusters.py
inputes:
1. first clustering output file
2. second clustering output file
output: value between 0 and 1, indicating how similar the clusters are
