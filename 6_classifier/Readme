## File description 

Step 1: skip_rate.py
To run this code - 
python skip_rate.py <num_clusters>
Input: 
line 9 - change to location of merge11_col.py
u_dict.pickle, 5_k_prototype.txt
line 55-56 - set the heard and skipped percentage
Output: skip_rate.pickle, pos.pickle, neg.pickle, item_dict.pickle

Step 2: logistic.py
To run this code - 
python logistic.py <num_clusters>
Input: 
skip_rate.pickle, item_dict.pickle (same folder, generated in prev step)
fetaues_equal_rates.csv, mdd_items.pickle (Data folder)
Output:
On console prints, F-scores of prediction and p values of features for every cluster 

Step 3: classifier.py
To run this code - 
python classifier.py <num_clusters>
Input: 
skip_rate.pickle, item_dict.pickle (same folder, generated in prev step)
fetaues_equal_rates.csv, mdd_items.pickle (Data folder)
Output:
prints mean test acc, mean train acc, and F-score of on classification for every cluster

pref_items.py
To run this code - 
python pref_items.py <num_clusters>
Input:
skip_rate.pickle, item_dict.pickle (same folder, generated in prev step)
fetaues_equal_rates.csv, mdd_items.pickle (Data folder)
Output: pos_res.pickle, nreg_res.pickle
