Step 1: Run python3 0_heard.py thresh_th1_th2.csv
thresh_th1_th2.csv would have been generated in the folder 1_power_user_extraction. This will generate a file 'user_preferences.txt'
containing preference vectors of all power users. A pickled dictionary u_dict.pickle will also be created which maps each user
to it's position in the vectors.

Step 2: 
first, uncomment line 84. 
Then run python3 1_entropy.py
note: please update the thresholds file name in line 9 of the code. 
The plot containing cumulative distribution of k-l divergence scores (log) will be plotted. Note the value you want to select as the cutoff.
Then, comment line 84 and update the threshold in the if condition in line 100.
Run python3 1_entropy.py again.
This will generate 2 files:
'cat_user_data_10_equal_rates.txt'- containing vectors of users having unique preferences (above threshold)
'new_u_dict.pickle'- containing dictionary of users with unique preferences

Step 3:
First uncomment lines 62-89 for plotting the k-prototype elbow curve. 
Run python3 2_k_prototype.py
This will plot the k-prototype elbow curve.
Select the optimal value and set it in line 18. Comment lines 62-89 again and run the code. 
A t-SNE plot visualising the clusters and a file 'n_clusters_k_prototype_equal_rates.txt' will be generated (where
n_clusters is the number of clusters set in line 18) containing which user belongs to which cluster. The users will be
identified by the numbers allotted in new_u_dict.pickle in step 2.
